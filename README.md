CleanO. aims to address the pressing issue of waste management prevalent in India, echoing similar challenges encountered globally. The inadequacy of efficient waste disposal infrastructures contributes to environmental deterioration, poses health risks, and undermines the overall well-being of communities. Kerala, in particular, finds itself entangled in the complexities of waste management. In response, we advocate for the creation of a sophisticated Waste Management Tracker harnessing the potential of cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence. This initiative synergizes the expertise of our proficient developers from @Founderfie and @Ad Web Comic Agency, aiming to revolutionize waste management practices through technological innovation.
